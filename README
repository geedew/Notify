 * Notify is a very easy to use and very robust notification system.
 *   It is NOT a Lightbox/Alert/Confirm system, just a notification system.
 *   Currently, it is not to be considered ready for production systems, but
 *   if you do know your way around JavaScript, then it should at least do much
 *   for you that you couldn't previously do yourself.
